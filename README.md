WordPress Humanity Box Widget
============
I put this widget together to make it eaiser to add the Humanity Box script to any WordPress powered site. After you
activate the plugin, it will add a widget to your site which will display ads from GiveForward.com in your prefered sidebar. 

Just add the widget to your sidebar, and <b>that's it!</b>

Humanity Box
============

Humanity Box is a free ad network designed to increase exposure to individuals
raising funds for personal medical needs.

What does it do?
----------------

Humanity Box works similarly to how paid ad networks work (such as
[The Deck](http://decknetwork.net/), [Carbon Ads](http://carbonads.net/),
[BSA One](http://bsaone.com/), etc). You install & activate the plugin, 
and it delivers advertisements from Giveforward.com in your site's sidebar 
on each page load.

The difference is that ads in the Humanity Box network are funding campaigns
for people are who sick and experiencing financial hardship as a result. The
campaigns are sourced from [GiveForward](http://www.giveforward.com/).

The ads link directly to the sourced campaign. No money ever changes hands
with Humanity Box. It is simply an experimental project for the sake of being
good.

Why does it exist?
------------------

No one should have to choose between bankruptcy or death.

Campaign providers such as [GiveForward](http://www.giveforward.com/) are
providing a vital service by allowing people to create funding campaigns to
help pay for medical treatments.  Oftentimes, however, the campaigns never
reach beyond friends, family, and other people specifically browsing the
platform looking to make donations.  While this is amazing in and of itself,
many campaigns never reach their goal.

Humanity Box's aim is to bring exposure to these campaigns to as many sites on
the internet as possible. We hope that by simply increasing traffic to these
campaigns we can help them get funded when they otherwise might not.

How does it work?
-----------------

We source funding campaigns from [GiveForward](http://www.giveforward.com/).

The ad code is delivered via [Amazon CloudFront](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/).

We display 10 campaigns per 24-hour period, after which we rotate in 10 new
campaigns.
